# Iris

Iris is a self-hosted safety monitor for kids' WhatsApp. It watches the chats and groups of one or more
kids' numbers through [OpenWA](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA), classifies **text, voice notes,
audio, images and video** for harmful content, and alerts a parent **over WhatsApp** with the kid, the chat,
the sender and the quoted message.

It is built for mixed Hebrew and English chats (nothing is hardcoded to a language), runs as a single Docker
container (amd64 and arm64), and uses free or low-cost models wherever possible.

> **Read this first.** Monitoring a child's messages is a sensitive decision. Use Iris openly and only for
> children you are responsible for, and make sure you are allowed to do so where you live. Iris is
> read-only: it never replies or interacts in a chat. It only sends alerts to the number you choose.

## Features

- **One webhook per number.** Each kid's WhatsApp session gets its own signed webhook; one number is one kid.
- **Text** is checked with OpenAI Moderation (a free endpoint).
- **Images and stickers** (with their caption) go through multimodal moderation.
- **Voice notes, audio and video** are transcribed (OpenAI or Cloudflare Workers AI, your choice), then the
  transcript is moderated.
- **Context-aware second look.** A message that is borderline is re-checked together with the previous
  messages in the same chat. If it is still unclear it lands in a **review queue** instead of a guess.
- **WhatsApp alerts** with the kid, chat, sender, category, score, time and the quoted message. A per-chat
  cooldown avoids floods and the next alert says how many were held back.
- **Both sessions monitored?** A message between two monitored kids is stored once, with both kids on it, and
  produces one alert.
- **Searchable archive** (SQLite FTS5, Hebrew and English) with filters, a chat-style context view and
  match highlighting.
- **A modern, responsive portal.** A sidebar on desktop, an icon rail on tablets, and a bottom tab bar on
  phones, so an alert link opens into something you can use one-handed. Light and dark themes follow your
  system, and the whole portal passes an automated accessibility scan (keyboard, contrast, screen readers).
- **Sexual content safety rule.** Content involving minors, or sexual imagery, is withheld entirely: it is
  not stored, not searchable, not shown and not forwarded. The alert says to review the chat directly.
- **Self-hosted and private.** Secrets are encrypted at rest, logs never contain message text, media is
  deleted after processing, and old data is removed automatically.
- Prometheus metrics, a REST API with interactive docs, and a multi-arch image.

## How it works

```

The webhook handler never calls an external API: it validates, stores, queues and answers `200`. All slow
work (downloading media, transcribing, moderating, alerting) happens in worker tasks inside the same process.
Iris runs as **one process on purpose**: the queue and SQLite assume it.

## Requirements

- Docker, on amd64 or arm64.
- An **OpenWA 0.24.0 or newer** server with one running session per monitored number. Older versions cannot
  download media that the session *receives* (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).
- An **OpenAI API key** for moderation (the moderation endpoint is free but rate limited). It is also used
  for transcription unless you choose Cloudflare.
- Optional: a Cloudflare account ID and API token for Workers AI transcription.
- A **public hostname or IP for Iris** that OpenWA can reach. OpenWA refuses to send webhooks to private
  network addresses (`Destination address is not allowed`), so a LAN IP will not work: use a reverse proxy or
  tunnel and expose only `/webhooks/*` if you can.

## Installation

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  iris:
    image: techblog/iris:latest
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    volumes:
      - iris-data:/data        # SQLite database; a named volume keeps non-root ownership
    environment:
      IRIS_SECRET_KEY: ""            # openssl rand -base64 32
      IRIS_ADMIN_USERNAME: admin     # first run only
      IRIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: ""        # first run only
      IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: https://iris.example.com   # what OpenWA can reach
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  iris-data:
```

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32      # paste into IRIS_SECRET_KEY, and back it up
docker compose up -d
```

Open the portal on port 8080 and sign in with the admin credentials. They are used only to create the first
account; change the password under **Settings → Account**.

![Login](assets/screenshots/login.png)

> **Back up `IRIS_SECRET_KEY`.** It encrypts every stored secret (API keys). Lose it and you must re-enter them.

The container runs as a non-root user (uid 10001), applies database migrations on start, and has a health
check on `/api/health`.

### Build from source

```bash
uv sync                                    # Python 3.12
cd web && npm ci && npm run build && cd .. # builds the portal into app/static
IRIS_SECRET_KEY=... IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
IRIS_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin IRIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me IRIS_DATA_DIR=./data \
  uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port 8080
```

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be installed (the Docker image includes them).

## Connecting OpenWA

1. In the portal go to **Phones → Add a phone** and enter the child's name, your OpenWA address, the
   OpenWA **session ID** (the full UUID, not the name) and an OpenWA API key that can use that session.
2. Click **Register in OpenWA**. Iris creates a webhook for `message.received` and
   `message.sent` and a signing secret, so deliveries are verified with an HMAC. If registration says the
   destination is not allowed, your `IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is a private address (see Requirements).
   You can also paste the shown URL (`https://…/webhooks/<token>`) into OpenWA by hand.
3. Repeat for every number you monitor.
4. Under **Settings → Alerts** choose the instance that **sends** alerts, enter the parent's number
   (international format, digits only, e.g. `972501234567`) and press **Test**. A real WhatsApp message is
   sent using the values you typed, before you save.

![Settings: alerts](assets/screenshots/settings-alerts.png)

![Phones](assets/screenshots/instances.png)

**New webhook address** cuts the old URL off immediately; register the new one afterwards. Each phone shows
when it last received a message, or **Nothing received yet**, and the Home screen flags phones that never
have. Use the switch to pause watching a phone without removing it.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IRIS_SECRET_KEY` | yes | | 32 bytes, base64. Encrypts secrets at rest and derives session and webhook signing keys. Iris will not start without it. |
| `IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | yes | | Externally reachable base URL, used to build webhook URLs and alert links. |
| `IRIS_ADMIN_USERNAME` | first run | | Initial admin user. |
| `IRIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | first run | | Initial admin password (stored hashed with argon2; ignored afterwards). |
| `IRIS_DATA_DIR` | no | `/data` | SQLite database and temporary media. |
| `IRIS_PORT` | no | `8080` | Listening port. |
| `IRIS_WORKERS` | no | `3` | Concurrent job workers. |
| `IRIS_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `INFO` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. |
| `IRIS_LOG_JSON` | no | `false` | JSON log lines. |
| `IRIS_METRICS_TOKEN` | no | unset | If set, `/metrics` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |
| `IRIS_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` | no | `127.0.0.1` | Your reverse proxy's IP, so the login rate limit sees real client addresses. |

### Settings (in the portal)

Everything else is edited under **Settings** and stored in the database. Secrets are write-only: the API and
UI only ever say whether one is set.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Providers | OpenAI API key | |
| Providers | Transcription provider (`openai` or `cloudflare`) | `openai` |
| Providers | OpenAI transcription model | `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` (or `whisper-1`) |
| Providers | Cloudflare account ID, API token, model | `@cf/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` |
| Classification | Moderation model | `omni-moderation-latest` |
| Classification | Per-category thresholds (low and high) | see below |
| Classification | Context window / max age | 8 messages / 6 hours |
| Alerts | Sender instance, recipient, cooldown, time zone | cooldown 10 min, `Asia/Jerusalem` |
| Alerts | Also alert on items needing review | off |
| Scope | Monitor messages sent by the kid, direct chats, groups | all on |
| Retention | Keep messages / alerts | 90 / 365 days |

Switching the transcription provider takes effect immediately, with no restart.

![Settings: providers](assets/screenshots/settings-providers.png)

![Settings: classification](assets/screenshots/settings-classification.png)

**Thresholds.** For each moderation category a score at or above **high** is harmful; between **low** and
**high** it is inconclusive and gets the context check; below **low** it is safe. Defaults are strictest for
`sexual/minors` (0.05 / 0.30) and self-harm (0.10 / 0.40), and loosest for general harassment, hate, illicit
and violence (0.20 / 0.70). Iris decides from the category scores, not from the API's own `flagged` flag.

## Using the portal

### Home

![Home](assets/screenshots/dashboard.png)

The **iris ring** answers the first question: all violet means all quiet; coral arcs are alerts waiting for
you and saffron arcs are messages Iris could not decide. Below it, **Needs attention** lists everything that
needs you or needs fixing (unread alerts, items to review, undelivered alerts, failed jobs, phones that never
reported) with a button for each, and the **activity chart** shows 14 days of messages by verdict. Everything
refreshes about every minute. The chart is also available as a table.

### Alerts

![Alerts](assets/screenshots/alerts.png)

Each alert shows the kid, chat, sender, categories with scores, the quote and whether it was delivered. Open
one to see how Iris decided, jump to the message **in its conversation**, **mark it as seen** or **dismiss**
it, or **send it again** if delivery failed.

![Alert detail](assets/screenshots/alert-detail.png)

The WhatsApp alert looks like this:

```
⚠️ Iris alert
Kid: Noa, Dan
Chat: Class 6B (group)
From: Yonatan
Category: harassment (0.98)
Time: 06/10 17:14

"You are a worthless idiot, nobody likes you, just disappear"

Open: https://iris.example.com/alerts/12?s=…
```

Voice-note quotes are prefixed with 🎤 and image, sticker and video captions with 🖼️. The signed link at the end lets Iris
recognise its own alerts if they come back through a monitored number, and it cannot be copied onto
different text.

### Messages and context

![Message search](assets/screenshots/messages-search.png)

Search matches words and prefixes in messages **and transcripts**, in Hebrew and English, with filters for
kid, chat, sender, type, verdict and dates. Open a message to see the surrounding chat with the message
highlighted and its classifications.

![Message in context](assets/screenshots/message-context.png)

### Review queue

![Review queue](assets/screenshots/review.png)

Messages that stayed inconclusive even with the surrounding chat wait here. **Mark safe** closes them;
**Mark harmful** creates an alert.

### Chats, instances, jobs

![Chats](assets/screenshots/chats.png)

![Jobs](assets/screenshots/jobs.png)

**Jobs** lists work that failed, with the reason, and a Retry button. A message that failed shows `failed`
and its reason in the message list (it is never silently shown as pending).

### On your phone

The portal is built for phones first: alert links from WhatsApp open straight into it. On a phone the
sidebar becomes a bottom tab bar (Home, Alerts, Review, Messages and a **More** sheet for Chats, Phones, Jobs,
Settings, the theme and sign out), filters tuck behind one **Filters** button, and every control is a
comfortable touch target.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ![Home on a phone](assets/screenshots/phone-dashboard.png) | ![Alerts on a phone](assets/screenshots/phone-alerts.png) | ![The More sheet](assets/screenshots/phone-more.png) |
| ![Filters sheet](assets/screenshots/phone-filters.png) | ![Review in dark mode](assets/screenshots/phone-review-dark.png) | |

### Light and dark

The portal follows your system's light or dark preference. Change it from the account menu (bottom of the
sidebar) or the **More** sheet: **System**, **Light** or **Dark**. The choice is remembered in the browser.

## API

All endpoints are under `/api`, return JSON, and need the session cookie from `POST /api/auth/login`,
except `/api/auth/login`, `/api/health` and `/api/version`. Interactive OpenAPI docs are at **`/api/docs`** and the schema at
`/api/openapi.json`, both behind the login.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/password` | Session login (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, 7 days; 5 failures per 15 minutes per IP), logout, change password |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | The signed-in user (401 when not signed in) |
| GET | `/api/health`, `/api/version` | Liveness (database and workers), version |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Dashboard numbers |
| GET | `/api/messages` | Search: `q`, `instance_id`, `chat_id`, `sender`, `type`, `verdict`, `from`, `to`, `page`, `page_size` (max 100) |
| GET | `/api/messages/{id}`, `/api/messages/{id}/context` | One message with classifications; surrounding messages |
| POST | `/api/messages/{id}/reprocess` | Re-queue classification (not for redacted messages) |
| GET | `/api/alerts`, `/api/alerts/{id}` | List with filters (`status`, `delivery_status`, `instance_id`, `chat_id`, `category`, `from`, `to`, `page`, `page_size`); detail |
| PATCH | `/api/alerts/{id}` | Set status to `new`, `acknowledged` or `dismissed` |
| POST | `/api/alerts/{id}/resend` | Send the alert again (ignores the cooldown) |
| GET, POST | `/api/review`, `/api/review/{message_id}` | Review queue; resolve as `safe` or `harmful` |
| GET | `/api/chats` | Known chats with kids and counts |
| GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/instances[/{id}]` | Manage monitored numbers (API keys are never returned) |
| POST | `/api/instances/{id}/rotate-token`, `/register-webhook` | Rotate the webhook token; register it in OpenWA |
| GET, PUT | `/api/settings` | Read and write settings (thresholds are the key `classification.thresholds`) |
| GET | `/api/settings/thresholds` | Effective per-category thresholds next to their defaults (read-only) |
| POST | `/api/settings/test/{openai\|cloudflare\|alert}` | Test a provider with the values entered |
| GET | `/api/jobs` | Failed and dead jobs with their errors |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{id}/retry` | Retry a failed or dead job |
| POST | `/webhooks/{token}` | OpenWA delivers here (authenticated by the token, and by an HMAC signature once Iris registered the webhook) |

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` (Prometheus text format):

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `iris_webhooks_total` | `instance`, `result` (accepted, duplicate, skipped, rejected) |
| `iris_messages_processed_total` | `type`, `verdict` |
| `iris_stage_duration_seconds` | `stage` |
| `iris_provider_requests_total` | `provider`, `endpoint`, `status` |
| `iris_provider_duration_seconds` | `provider`, `endpoint` |
| `iris_transcription_seconds_audio_total` | `provider` |
| `iris_alerts_total` | `category`, `delivery_status` |
| `iris_jobs` | `status` |

`/metrics` is open by default. Because OpenWA needs Iris's port for webhooks, that port may be reachable from
outside, so set `IRIS_METRICS_TOKEN` or restrict `/metrics` in your reverse proxy.

## Privacy and security

- **Sign-in required** for the portal and every API except health and version. Webhooks are authenticated by
  a 32-byte random, rotatable token and, once registered through Iris, an HMAC signature.
- **Secrets are encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM) and never returned by the API.
- **Logs contain only IDs, types, categories, scores and timings**, never message text, transcripts or media.
- **Media is never kept.** It is downloaded to a per-job temporary directory and deleted afterwards, also on
  failure and on shutdown; leftovers from a crash are swept at start-up. Only media with a recognised audio,
  video or image signature is passed to ffmpeg.
- **Sexual content is withheld.** If a message involves minors (from the *low* threshold up), or is a
  sexual image, sticker or video, Iris clears its text and transcript, removes it from the search index,
  never quotes it in an alert, and refuses to reprocess it.
- **Retention.** Messages older than the retention window are deleted hourly, except while an alert still
  references them; alerts are deleted after their own window; finished jobs after 7 days.
- **Alert-loop protection.** Iris recognises its own alerts by a signature over the whole alert text, so an
  alert that reaches a monitored number is not classified, while a look-alike typed by someone else is.
- Security headers (CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`) are set, and the
  container runs as a non-root user.
- Use HTTPS in front of Iris. Session cookies are marked `Secure` when `IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` starts with
  `https://`.

## Troubleshooting

**Messages show `failed` with "OpenWA has no stored media…".** OpenWA could not download the media of a
message the session *received*. This is a known bug in OpenWA before 0.24.0
([#1739](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA/issues/1739)): upgrade OpenWA, then press **Reprocess** on the
message. Text is unaffected.

**"Destination address is not allowed" when registering the webhook.** OpenWA blocks private-network
webhook targets. Put Iris behind a public hostname (reverse proxy or tunnel) and set `IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
to it.

**No alert arrived.** Open the alert: **Delivery** says why (`not configured`, an OpenWA error, or
`suppressed` by the per-chat cooldown). Check that the sender session is running, then **Resend**. The
**Test** button under Settings → Alerts verifies the sender and recipient.

**A phone shows "Nothing received yet".** OpenWA cannot reach `IRIS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, or the webhook was
not registered. Check the URL from the OpenWA host.

**A borderline message was flagged.** Context can raise a score: a casual "you're dead meat, lol" after a
tense exchange may be judged harmful. Dismiss the alert, or raise the threshold for that category.

**Everything is slow or jobs pile up.** The dashboard shows queue depth. Moderation is rate limited by
OpenAI: Iris retries with backoff and honours `Retry-After`. Raise `IRIS_WORKERS` only if the queue stays long.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy
uv run pytest                    # unit tests: no network, providers mocked
uv run pytest -m integration     # real OpenAI (needs TEST_* variables, see .env.example)

cd web
npm ci && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build   # builds into ../app/static
npm run dev                      # Vite dev server, proxies /api to :8080
```

Layout: `app/` is the FastAPI backend (`ingest/`, `openwa/`, `jobs/`, `media/`, `transcription/`,
`classify/`, `alerts/`, `api/`), `web/` is the React portal, `tests/` mirrors it with real captured and
sanitized OpenWA payloads under `tests/fixtures/openwa/`. New classification stages plug into
`app/classify/stages.py`.

CI runs lint, type checks, tests, the portal build, a security scan, and builds the image for **both**
linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 on every pull request.
